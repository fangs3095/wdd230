        <p>Lego Bionicleis, is the Lego most Iconic theme that they have ever made. I remeber when I was in elemtery
            school the first tast of Lego Bionicle I got was when I went ot my friends house to watch Lego Bionicle The
            Legend Reborn. It was also at this same friend house that we played with some of thier Lego Bioncile sets.
            From then on I was fascinated with the franchie. While I was not there not see it's begining, I also saw the
            end to the original Bionicle. However there was a bright light in the end of the tunle. In 2014 Lego realase
            it's younger sibling Lego Hero Factory. Hero Factory in its wave 2 introduced us to CCBS. CCBS stands for
            Charater, Creature Building System. Then in 2015, Lego shocked us a with Lego Bionicle G, but it was
            rebooted from the original series. The original Toawere introduced, along with the Protectors of their
            respective elements. But it didn't last long, as after two years of it the series ended once again. A bitter
            seet end to a franchies that was, and stil is loved so much. But this is not the end rumours have stated
            that in 2025 Lego will be bringing Lego Bionicle back.</p>

        <p class="matabot">"It is said that all endings are merely beginnings, waiting to be born. My beginning was much
            the same." - Mata Nui. The world of Lego Bioncile is based on the author of the lore of the Lego Bionicle
            series. He was suffering formm cancer and had to take medication to help witht the treatment. He then tought
            that what if each canister had a tiny solider to fight agints the canncer. </p>
        <img src="images/mata_nui.jpeg" alt="nui">
        <P>When Mata Nui nearly died his evil brother Makuda seeked into the brain of the Matu Nui robot. Makuda
            too over Mata Nui body and ejected the spirt of Mata Nui into space. But in doing this he also
            ejected the mask of life. Which gave Mata Nui a Chance to save the Matorni universe. Mata Nui Landed
            on the planted know by the locals as Baramagma. A desolated world where resorces where earn by
            Glator Battles. Mata Nui is reborn on this planet, where he fights to save the people of Baramaga
            from the united forces of the Skrall, and the Bone Hunters. </P>
