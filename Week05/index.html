        <p>Each site has key words that help you find what I was looking for in a website. In each page they talk about what I was wanting to learn about whether it be snakes venom or a how is a lego brick made. They each wrote sentece that where long. But each of them had me hooked in while I was reading about what is was resurching. While what you might like is not what I would like to read about. That may be true, however while I was reading I found out that the way it was writen was to encurge every one to read more about there topics. As they where writng about each of there respective topics they rarely repete what they where saying enlse they want to link back to something that where talking about earler in the webpage. Every thing that was able to be talked about was infact spasfic to what they where able to talk about. While Lego is seceritive about there process. The writer was able to tell you about what they could. For the snake venom they gave us all of the information, that they curtectly had about what snake venom does and how it works. For an example depending on what snake that bit you depends on the effects of the venom. I learned that some venom is ment to paralze there pray. Or as more comonly know to strike there pray then let the posion kill them. Then the snake will track down its pray and then eat it.</p>
